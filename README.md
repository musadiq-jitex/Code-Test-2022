# Code-Test-2022

## Code Refactor (app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php)
- Cognitive Complexity of functions should not be too high
- Control structures should use curly braces (While not technically incorrect, the omission of curly braces can be misleading, and may lead to the introduction of errors during maintenance.)
- Unused local variables should be removed

## Code Refactor (app/Repository/BookingRepository.php)
- Cognitive Complexity of functions should not be too high
- String literals should not be duplicated
- Control structures should use curly braces
- Add curly braces around the nested statement(s)
- Remove the unused local variable.
- Remove the commented out code.
- Array values should not be replaced unconditionally
- Unused local variables should be removed
- Local variables should not be declared and then immediately returned or thrown
- Boolean literals should not be redundant
- Local variables should not have the same name as class fields
- Unused function parameters should be removed

# Thoughts about the code
My thought about the code was good.
